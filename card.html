			<p>The Asian Elephant is a large mammal with grey wrinkled skin that is smoother than the African Elephants' skins, and it contains many nerve centers. Their trunks are an elongation of the nose and upper lip combined. Their tusks are used to dig for water, debark and uproot trees, and as weapons. </p>
